Advanced Feature Flipper (toggle) for Symfony2
==============================================

This bundle provides a feature flipper interface for Symfony2. (Planned) Main features:

- Feature checks in twigs and controllers (via DI)
- Assigning expiration date to features
- Assigning responsible people to features

Note: This bundle is not yet available through Composer as it is currently in development!

    "require": {
        ...

        feature_class: Rutkai\FeatureFlipperBundle\Feature\Feature  # Default feature container, must implement FeatureInterface
        features:
            feature_id:
                enabled: true
                expiration: 2015-03-03 12:00:00
                responsible: "AndrÃ¡s Rutkai"
